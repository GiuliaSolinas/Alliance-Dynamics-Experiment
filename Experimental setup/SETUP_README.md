# Alliance Dynamics Experiment

## CONTENTS

Experimental setup files for eight treatments:

- High competition alliances (PD) (i) with two partners and (ia) no exit cost or (ib) exit cost; (ii) with three partners and (iia) no exit cost or (iib) exit cost.

- Low competition alliances (CG) (i) with two partners and (ia) no exit cost or (ib) exit cost; (ii) with three partners and (iia) no exit cost or (iib) exit cost.

Each treatment has two setup files: one for the first interaction and one for later interactions. The program for the first interaction contains detailed instructions and the entry quiz to check for understanding. The program for later treatments repeats automatically indefinitely, until a certain random variable takes a certain value. This implements the "infinite repetition" of our experiment.

Requirement for running these programs: **ztree** and **zleaf** release 15 or newer. [Fischbacher, U. (2007). “z-Tree: Zurich Toolbox for Ready-made Economic Experiments.” Experimental Economics 10, pp. 171–178.]
